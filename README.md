# 8085-system-to-detect-over-speeding-on-Highways
This repository contains files for an electronics project to detect overspeeding on highways

## Components
* IR sensor module
* AT89S52 IC
* 16*2 LCD monitor
* Breadboard, resistors, and wires

AT89S52 is activated by interrupts generated by the IR module. There are two IR sensors. These sensors detect motion and send voltage signals.
When the microcontroller recieves the first interrrupt, it starts waiting for the second interrup to come. 
Once the second interrupt is recieved, the microcontroller decides the time difference betweem these interrupts. The distance between the IR
modules is fixed and known. Dividing this distance by the time, will give us the speed with which an object moved.

When the object overspeed, an indicator is shown on the LCD module, which also displays the speed of the object
